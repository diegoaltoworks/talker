/**
 * The gate between an unreviewed dependency bump and npm — `bun scripts/release-guard.ts`,
 * run by the publish workflow before it builds anything.
 *
 * The rule it enforces is narrow: nothing an upstream maintainer wrote reaches
 * the registry under our name without a human having read it. Dependabot opens
 * the PR, auto-merge lands it, and CI goes green without anyone reading the
 * diff — so publishing off that commit would put someone else's code on npm
 * under our name unattended.
 *
 * Refusing to publish any range dependabot touched would enforce that rule and
 * deadlock on it: only a successful publish moves the tag the scan starts from,
 * so one routine bump would freeze the release train and every fix behind it.
 * The way out is that the two kinds of bump are not the same commit. A bump
 * that edits only a manifest or a lockfile changes which versions this package
 * *declares*; it ships no upstream code, and the gates run against it like any
 * other commit. A bump that edits a workflow, a Dockerfile or source — the
 * github-actions and docker ecosystems both do — changes what runs, and that is
 * the case worth stopping. So only the second kind blocks, the common case can
 * never wedge the train, and a block is always cleared by one
 * `workflow_dispatch` (a maintainer putting their name on the change), which
 * publishes and moves the tag past it.
 *
 * The pure half is exported and unit-tested in scripts/release-guard.test.ts.
